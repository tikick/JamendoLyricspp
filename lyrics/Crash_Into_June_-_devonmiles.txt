too much comfort
always ruins inspiration
place yourself in the action
this is a daily quest for passion

emergency 
we need to be
in a rush
in a rush for something

and as we crash into june
we'll have no excuses
if we deceive somebody
if we deceive someone

i keep my head fresh
helped by a bit of loneliness
erase the untold shout the unwritten
there can't be last minute corrections

emergency 
we need to be
in a rush
in a rush for something

and as we crash into june
we'll have no excuses
if we deceive somebody
if we deceive someone

and as we crash into june
we'll have no excuses
if we deceive somebody
if we deceive someone
