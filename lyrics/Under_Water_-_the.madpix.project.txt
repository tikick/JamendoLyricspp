i was there when the clouds parted
do you remember the day we met
i walked the ocean
i remember the night you told me
never to get too close
cause your cold heart would leave me burned
would leave me

and i touched down on the surface
and it hurt like love
it hurt like love that was temporary
and you touched my hand and we kissed
and it hurt like love
it hurt like love that was temporary

you can't run run run run run underwater
when we begun i craved your love
you pulled me under

you can't run run run run run underwater
when we begun i craved your love
you pulled me under

you can't run run run run run underwater
when we begun i craved your love
you pulled me under

you can't run run run run run underwater
when we begun i craved your love
you pulled me under

you can't run run run run run underwater
when we begun i craved your love
you pulled me under
