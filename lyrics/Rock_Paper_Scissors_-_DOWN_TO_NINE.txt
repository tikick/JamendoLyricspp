i see the trouble in believing in fate
or holy destiny deciding on our way
someone almighty playing an almighty game
i would rather hold this power in my hand

a rock seems solid but it's not only that
paper seems fragile but it has a skill to wrap
and scissors are sharp but they're easy to break
rock paper scissors i'm telling you my friends

so i say it's a fair game
and we play about everything
just one tool let me see your hand
rock paper scissors till the end

and so there shall be a new order from today
in wars economies in politics and trade
something all encompassing something non rational
rock paper scissors decides on these things

so i say it's a fair game
and we play about everything
just one tool let me see your hand
rock paper scissors till the end

i say
one two three rock
one two three paper
one two three scissors
one two three oh

so i say it's a fair game
and we play about everything
just one tool let me see your hand
rock paper scissors till the end
