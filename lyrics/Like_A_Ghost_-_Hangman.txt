it was in the early morning
when i found out that she was gone
left me behind without any trace
i couldn't understand why

where can you be my dear
oh no where can you be my dear i cried

i can see a tear from the eye
running in the woods and
suddenly there she was

there i stood with my mouth agape
i could not believe anything
it was such a shock for me to see
my wife hanging there by the tree

oh no this cannot be real i said
oh no it cannot be new i cried

i can see a tear from the eye
crying like a baby
who would have thought
this couldn't be happening to me

she opened her eyes and smiled
don't be afraid my dear
this was meant to happen come along
just take my hand my dear nathan no

right after the dawn they came along
accused me to murder and took me away
locked me down into this cold cell
only i know i was not insane

where can you be my dear
oh no where can you be my dear i cried

i can see a tear from the eye
running in the woods and
suddenly there she was
like a ghost
