how many spoonfuls how much sugar
watch life go on switch on to it
night closees in the street sings songs
a maternity ward where the day is born to the sea
not far from me

the waves will not ever clean the strand
still i'll draw pictures in the sand

the night is full of wasted dreams waves of sleep will smother me
stay awake instead
the night is where i grow my plans cup of coffee warms my hands
stay awake stay awake stay awake

how many spoonfuls how much sugar
the light goes on switch off again
how many thoughts how many songs
i know i'm right but then i think i'm wrong
ah the see slowly rising over me

the waves will not ever clean the strand
still i'll draw pictures in the sand

the night is full of wasted dreams waves of sleep will smother me
stay awake instead
the night is where i grow my plans cup of coffee warms my hands
stay awake stay awake stay awake

the night is full of wasted dreams waves of sleep will smother me
stay awake instead
the night is where i grow my plans cup of coffee warms my hands
stay awake stay awake stay awake

the night is full of wasted dreams waves of sleep will smother me
stay awake instead
the night is where i grow my plans cup of coffee warms my hands
stay awake stay awake stay awake
