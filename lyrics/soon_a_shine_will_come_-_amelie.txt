man don't ride back to your past
praying all gods to take a rest
now a light's coming

on your side your consciousness
slowly flows through all this mess
now light's sparkling

soon you'll realise your head spins round and round
shoot the breeze
how can you stop revenge dragging you down
how

man don't hide the sun in your past
shades of all sorts there to fit out a nest
light is coming
soon a shine will come

soon you'll realise your head spins round and round
shoot the breeze
how can you stop revenge dragging you down
how

soon you'll realise your head spins round and round
shoot the breeze
how can you stop revenge dragging you down
how
