listen to me
i believe our time is up
unless you prove me wrong
then this love's corrupt
you're never home
that which is my heart
this barren land you've chosen not to roam

i tried to give you my company
but i see that's something you won't accept
what you see is shaped by your beliefs
i wish i believed in us except

i already know that it's over
so i'll try my best not to make believe
i feel alright though i'm not sober
i'm drowning in this misery

so god please set me free
god please set me free

i beg of you
as i watch my bitterness flow
just take my hand
and allow our love to grow
this is the hardest i've fallen
now surrounded by gloom
i'd much rather you be here
to help cure these wounds

i'm lying in this halfdead coma
waiting for my heart to beat
i feel as though i've dug my final home
in the back of love's retreat

i already know that it's over
so i'll try my best not to make believe
i feel alright though i'm not sober
i'm drowning in this misery

so won't you set me free
please set me free from this
i know what i believe shapes what i see
so please won't you save me
and release me from this

i alread know that it's over
so i'll try my best not to make believe
i feel alright though i'm not sober
yeah i'm drowning in this misery
so god please free me

i already know that it's over
so i'll try my best not to make believe
i feel like hell and i'm far from sober
yeah i'm drowning in this misery
so god please free me
