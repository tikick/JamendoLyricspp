i took a wrong turn
a thousand miles back
but i let it go so long ago
i threw away the map

i should have known where i was going
and i should know where i am
it's a different place a different face a different name
but somehow the same

it's like a lost and found
when i turn around
it's twenty twenty

well the fog was wrapped around me
it settled in for years
but now the day has pushed it all away
my mind is getting clear

so i followed all the breadcrumbs
and i tried to find the track
but i can't return that bridge was burned the first time i went past
but i keep looking back

it's like a lost and found
when i turn around
it's twenty twenty

i don't regret what hasn't happened
but i wonder what would be
it's only memories i'll never see and places i won't go
and curiousity

it's like a lost and found
when i turn around
it's twenty twenty

and if i knew it then
i wouldn't run again
it's twenty twenty
