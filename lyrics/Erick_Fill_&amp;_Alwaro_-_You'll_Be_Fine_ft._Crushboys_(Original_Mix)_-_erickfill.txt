be careful what you wish for
cuz you might just get it
i wanted your love
now i regret it
you come over so unannounced
youʼre staying late and sneaking out oh baby
i know you crazy
oh you say
all i do is play games
but i donʼt wanna play games
with you

youʼll be fine
baby youʼll find someone whoʼs gonna love you
more than i can
girl in time
when you think of us you wonʼt cry
baby our love ran dry
it donʼt mean you wonʼt love again
i just canʼt fake it canʼt pretend
so wipe those tears that fall from your eyes
baby youʼre fine
i canʼt be the one but i tried
i know in time weʼll be fine

i donʼt know what you thought
but i wonʼt forget it
fighting for your love
even though its done already
i donʼt feel like iʼm even here iʼm too afraid to make it clear oh baby
i know you crazy
you said if you canʼt have me then nobody stands a chance
you want my heart but wonʼt listen you just only make demands
girl itʼs over
build a bridge and get over what we did
cuz i know its a matter of time

youʼll be fine
baby youʼll find someone whoʼs gonna love you
more than i can
girl in time
when you think of us you wonʼt cry
baby our love ran dry

you donʼt have to be alone and if so then not for long
we did everything you want and i found out its not right for us
when its said and done
i know that youʼre not the one
i donʼt wanna make you sad but i know that
