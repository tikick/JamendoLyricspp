it's not the way you wear your hair
i don't think that you could look much better
it's not the smell of your perfume
that's not the sort of thing that makes me tremor

you coming west with me
i'll follow you though i really should know better
i'll never learn

i can't mistake your callous eye
must admit it draws me ever closer
i don't care what they say to me
you're dangerous it makes me want you more

we're going west now woman
you got me eating out of your hand
that's bad

i'm not sure if i'm on my own
can't believe i'm in this mess again
the taste of freedom's sickly sweet
the advance of love is harder to defend

i'm going west with you
i'll follow you though i really should know better
i'll never learn

i know it's wrong
but who can carry on without it

i know it's wrong
but who can get along without it
