i'll take up arms
i'll take up arms against persecution
i'll take up arms
i'll take and say no no no no no

i'll take up arms
i'll take up arms against persecution
i'll take up arms
i'll take and say no no no no no

i'll take up arms
i'll take up arms against persecution
i'll take up arms
i'll take and say no no no no no

i'll be armed to the teeth
and i'll spread myself like wild fire
a mass deportation of my ideas
i'll deploy all over my sonor troops

i'll invade the world of all sonority
and i'll irradiate your mind

i'll take up arms
i'll take up arms against persecution
i'll take up arms
i'll take and say no no no no no

i'll take up arms
i'll take up arms against persecution
i'll take up arms
i'll take and say no no no no no

i anihilate and destroy with a machine gun
all the record company
a melody the sound and open mind
i pull nuclear of my tape record

and i spin around and waltz on your music
i hum your ideas the tune

i'll take up arms
i'll take up arms against persecution
i'll take up arms
i'll take and say no no no no no

i'll take up arms
i'll take up arms against persecution
i'll take up arms
i'll take and say no no no no no

i'll take up arms
i'll take up arms against persecution
i'll take up arms
i'll take and say no no no no no

i'll take up arms
i'll take up arms against persecution
i'll take up arms
i'll take and say no no no no no
