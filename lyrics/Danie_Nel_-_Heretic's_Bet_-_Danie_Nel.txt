few have ever seen the truth
yet they look into it every day
i weep when i sleep
oh can't you see it

fate is taking bets
and will you find your way home
faith is running wild
caught in confusion
why this is the question i bet

few have ever known what it's like to live
forever and another day
i hope you do wonder

fate is taking bets
and will you find your way home
faith is running wild
caught in confusion
why this is the question i bet

look at the children they're not naive
look at your truth what do you believe
the world's in denial they think it's ok
but they'll be surprised when they see

fate is taking bets
and will you find your way home
faith is running wild
caught in confusion
why this is the question i bet
