crystals in our eyes
making everyone blind
gone so far
missed the start

heard it all
i am outside now
took a fall
i got lost somehow

looking to the skies
wishing i couldn't die
where's your star
am i far

heard it all
i am outside now
took a fall
i got lost somehow

we know love can't go away
we know love can't go away

heard it all
i am outside now
took a fall
i got lost somehow

we know love can't go away
we know love can't go away
we know love
we know
we know love
we know
we know love can't go away
