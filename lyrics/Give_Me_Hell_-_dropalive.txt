somewhat a contradiction
you really make my day
each time you try to give me pain

how long can you go on
get set when you're done it's my turn
you're gonna pay

still not burning
up and running
do your best and
give me hell

you tell me to surrender
but why would i do that
you're gonna fall

whatever you may say
you'll get my middle finger
go on and pick on me

still not burning
up and running
do your best and
give me hell

give me hell
give me hell
give me hell
give me hell

still not burning
up and running
do your best and
give me hell

still not burning
give me hell
still not burning
