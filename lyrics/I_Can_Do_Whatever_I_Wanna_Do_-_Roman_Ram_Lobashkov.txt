i can do whatever i wanna do
i can go wherever i wanna go

i can choose what i want
let me live on my own
i can say what i want
let me be on my own

when it hurts i just hold tight
to make it mine
i can turn black into white
it blows my mind
well i know i'll get it down the line

i can take whatever i wanna take
i can build whatever i wanna build

i can choose what i want
let me live on my own
i can think what i want
let me stay on my own

i can do that
i can do that
i can do that
oh baby oh yeah
i can do that
i can do that
i can do that
oh baby oh yeah
i can do that
i can do that
i can do that
oh baby oh yeah
i can do that
i can do that
i can do that
oh baby oh yeah
