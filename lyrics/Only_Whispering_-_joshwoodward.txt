the secret codes the marigolds
the twisted subway lines
the cheap motels the dinner bells
the buzzing neon signs
the candy stores and filthy whores
the rotting picket fence
somehow all this folderol
is starting to make sense

the splintered rope the microscope
i thought i had it all figured out
the magazine the tv screen
the faces burned with doubt
it swirled and twirled this tiny world

until it somehow all made sense
this apple tree epiphany
this fleeting glimpse of common sense

and now i'm screaming on the crowded streets
i'm telling everyone that i meet
but no matter what i try to say i'm only whispering

the fire codes the one way roads
the government conspiracy
the thin facade the red man's god
it all just seems so clear to me
the foreign places with the hungry faces
the broke down chevrolet
the race to see the ending
past the stops on the way

and now i'm screaming on the crowded streets
i'm telling everyone that i meet

but no matter what i try to say i'm only whispering
but no matter what i try to say no one is listening

all i got's this same old plot
and a rusty set of strings
i'll rehearse this same old verse
until there's nothing left to sing

but no matter what i try to say i'm only whispering
no matter what i try to say nobody's listening
no matter what i try to say i'm only whispering
