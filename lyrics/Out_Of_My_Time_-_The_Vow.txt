i'm out on my own again though i'm not blue
i don't feel the lonely pain some others do
for those who try to shape my mind you haven't got a clue
i'm through with you

i'm wiser and wizened now this much is true
i don't get surprised much now by what you do
the blue phases pass in fashion fads disguised as something new
there's nothing new

that's me and i'm fine got my car my guitar and my beer and i'm fine
i'll be out of line out of tune out of place out of phase out of mind
out of my time

if you want to be want to be all that you've got to be
climb out of the minds of men from ivory towers
climb over their swords and pens  their mighty powers
no lies to spiel no high ideals to hopelessly pursue
i'm through with you

that's me and i'm sound got my head in the clouds and my feet on the ground
i'll be out of line out of tune out of place out of phase out of mind
out of my time

the blue phases pass in fashion fads disguised as something new
there's nothing that's new

that's me and i'm fine got my car my guitar and my beer and i'm fine
i'll be out of line out of tune out of place out of phase out of mind
out of my time

oh you've got to be got to be all that you want to be
