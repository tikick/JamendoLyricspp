i used to be so logical but now all my nerves
are overheated lighting fireworks my head is submerged
in some demented disco carnival i know it's absurd
i heard people are a little bit concerned

i don't wanna be cured
i don't feel sick
it's only nerves
don't want to quiet my brain
i want everybody else to be insane

i used to be methodical and ordered inside
but now the screaming electricity has damaged my mind
and all the doctors and the nurses and the sanity meds
can't stop any of the crazy in my head

i don't wanna be cured
i don't feel sick
it's only nerves
don't want to quiet my brain
i want everybody else to be insane

i've got a lot of pills for psychotropic pain
they look so pretty when they're circling the drain

i don't i don't wanna lose
i don't want to be cured
i don't i don't wanna lose
i don't feel sick
it's only my nerves
