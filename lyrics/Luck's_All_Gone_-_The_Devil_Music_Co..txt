it's inescapable i'm gonna let you down
shoul've seen it coming knew the checks would bounce
in a borrowed bedroom of a cheap motel
guess i'll keep on driving till the gas runs out

when i'm shit faced with the wrong keys to the motel room
dropped my last dime down the storm drain of a toll phone booth
could you find me would you take me home
will you love me when my lucks all gone

i've got some problems can you tell
on the devil's highway and i can't slow down
but i've been thinking you're best i've found
will you be my reason to turn around

when i'm shit faced with the wrong keys to the motel room
dropped my last dime down the storm drain of a toll phone booth
could you find me would you take me home
will you love me when i'm all washed up

when the porch light of my last chance has been turned off
took a short cut to the dead end of a lonely road
when i'm tripped up and can't break my fall will you love me when my luck's all gone

when i'm shit faced with the wrong keys to the motel room
dropped my last dime down the storm drain of a toll phone booth
could you find me would you take me home
will you love me when i'm all washed up

when the porch light of my last chance has been turned off
took a short cut to the dead end of a lonely road
when i'm tripped up and can't break my fall will you love me when my luck's all gone
