you and i were
hiding in our rooms
while the sky burned
getting high off of the fumes
feeling like the
bombs outside were
fireworks

me and you stayed
watching through the glass
as the moon caved
bodies holding hands
feeling truly like our
lives were movies

i swear it's all a dream
no need to be afraid
someday we'll fall asleep
and won't recall a thing
some believe there's no escape
like pain's supposed to hurt
but i just don't agree
i love the way we see the world

but i just don't agree
i love the way we see the world
i just don't agree
i love the way we see the world

we both lied there
staring at the sun
we spent our nightmares
falling into love
i know you feel this
can't tell us what real is

i swear it's all a dream
no need to be afraid
someday we'll fall asleep
and won't recall a thing
some believe there's no escape
like pain's supposed to hurt
but i just don't agree
i love the way we see the world

but i just don't agree
i love the way we see the world
i just don't agree
i love the way we see the world

i swear it's all a dream
no need to be afraid
someday we'll fall asleep
and won't recall a thing
some believe there's no escape
like pain's supposed to hurt
but i just don't agree
i love the way we see the world
