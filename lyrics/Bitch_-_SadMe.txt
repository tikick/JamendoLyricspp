it's a little fussy
when you try to speak
don't know what you really mean
ok i'll pretend all meek

take off your disastrous hat
it doesn't suit you
no i really worry about you
someone will shoot you

bitch
aha

if you wanna show off
if you wanna smile
if you wanna laugh at me
for a while

i'm a late visitor
at your back door
when you go to bed
don't forget to lock up before

bitch
aha

send your lovers
greetings from me
they can be nice inside
not good enough for me

they've got no style no selfcontrol
how can you win
only if the army of your slaves
do it for you begin

woh oh na na na na na na
woh oh na na na na na na
woh oh na na na na na na
woh

woh oh na na na na na na
woh oh na na na na na na
woh oh na na na na na na

maybe i can make you shut up
maybe i can make you hide

baby pushed too far now
baby pushed too far now
baby pushed too far now
woh na na na na na na

baby pushed too far now
baby pushed too far now
baby pushed too far now
woh na na na na na oh
