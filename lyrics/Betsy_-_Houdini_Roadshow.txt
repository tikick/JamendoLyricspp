i got a real bad thing got a bad desease
and i know it's all about you
i saw you play got blown away
and i knew there ain't no cure

i know you're the kind of girl that is hard to satisfy
but i know you've been watching me from the corner of your eye
yeah sure you know how to rock you know how to shake that ass
you know the crowd just stands and stares

still i don't know why but i had to try
so i got you that one drink
you smiled at me didn't say a word
turned around with one last wink

i know you're the kind of girl that is hard to satisfy
but i know you've been watching me from the corner of your eye
yeah sure you know how to rock you know how to shake that ass
you know the crowd just stands and stares

recall i said baby i'm sure we meet again
that time i know for sure that you will know me
recall i said baby i'm sure we meet again
that time i know for sure that you will know me

next time i know you will know me
next time i know you will know me
next time i know you will know me
next time i know i will show you

recall i said baby i'm sure we meet again
that time i know for sure that you will know me
recall i said baby i'm sure we meet again
that time i know for sure that you will know me
