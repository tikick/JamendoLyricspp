in summertime
the stars will shine
the church bells always ring true
the ocean tide belongs to the moon
and the nighttime belongs to you

the trees will grow
the streams will flow
the mockingbird sings a tune
the sun belongs to the hot afternoon
and the nighttime belongs to you

the fox is out
he roams about
the squirrels climb high for a view
the forest belongs to the rambling raccoon
and the nighttime belongs to you

the bees will buzz
the river floods
grandmother's flowers are in bloom
old man winter belongs in his tomb
and the nighttime belongs to you

in wintertime
my friends will hide
away while the snow passes through
we'll meet again come april or june
when the nighttime belongs to you
the nighttime belongs to you
