somewhere on west eighty third
two strangers met in the night
no his nor hellos were spoken
only music from amsterdam avenue could be heard

they strolled to the east
they got lost in the park
they followed a night bird that led them to the turtle pound
they sat in the moonlight and listened to the sleepy night

beating sirens from the city's heart
screaming horns from honking cabs
