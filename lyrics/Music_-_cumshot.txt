i said sometimes the music just takes over
it even happenes to me when i'm totally sober
and if it would be a woman i swear i'd love her
love her for being a genious

well i walk down the street concrete jungle is so deep
there's so much pressure pulling me down that i can hardly move my feet
when people say world's in trouble all i say is indeed
and i'm not sure but i think that i will kill myself 'cause i bleed
but when i hear this sweet music have no fear i'm gonna choose it
instead of biting the dust 'cause i just don't wanna lose it
'cause when you die you get deaf guess that's the problem i have
committing suicide so i do it right
and i got no choice but to choose the life

it even happenes to me when i'm totally sober
and if it would be a woman i swear i'd love her
love her for being a genious 

talking 'bout women yesterday i met this beautiful girl
she came over to me smilin' and shakin' her golden curls
she said boy i've been looking for a guy like you all over the world
won't you come to my flat i got a surprise you could get
so first i thought why not take the chance
but then i just remembered my plans
to meet a couple friends and go to a reggae dance
so i said sorry girl i'd like to hang out but i think i need to go
you're beautiful there is no doubt but i need to see the show because

sometimes the music just takes over
it even happenes to me when i'm totally sober
and if it would be a woman i swear i'd love her
love her for being a genious 

we love music we can't get enough
we love music we love it so much
we love music every day and every night
we love music it makes our day so bright

i said music music is so precious
i said music music is so priceless
music music is the one thing i love
'cause music music is what life is

i said music music is so precious
i said music music is so priceless
music music is the one thing i love
'cause music music is what life is
