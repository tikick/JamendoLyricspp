i waited so long
holding your hand
thinking that time would tell you
that i was your man
but you see my problems
and i see your fears
i'm fighting the thunder
holding my tears

bye bye love
maybe i'll write
or send you a post card
some dark lonely night
bye bye love
i guess it wasn't meant to be
but i'll always love you
in my mind
secretly

love is not simple
love is not kind
it gets me in trouble
most of the time
my hands are too soft
and i know i'm not strong
i'm waiting for god to show me
why this seems wrong

bye bye love
maybe i'll write
or send you a post card
some dark lonely night
bye bye love
i guess it wasn't meant to be
but i'll always love you
in my mind
secretly

bye bye love
maybe i'll write
or send you a post card
some dark lonely night
bye bye love
i guess it wasn't meant to be
but i'll always love you
in my mind
secretly
