through the night i'm feeling like a shadow
i'm closed to the edge of madness
running till i found tomorrow
my own way i won't lose my faith

listening to the skies outside
i understand who i am
i understand who i was
so many time

it's because i love you too i don't want you to carry me anymore
this music may remind me you this sound is seizing me all alone
it's because i love you too i don't want you to carry me anymore anymore
this music may remind me you this sound is seizing me all alone

now i hear this song i can't forget
remembering my baby
like a key unlocking a door
like a light in my memory

i know you've supported me so long
i know you love me so much
but i think you'd better go
live your life leave me

it's because i love you too i don't want you to carry me anymore
this music may remind me you this sound is seizing me all alone
it's because i love you too i don't want you to carry me anymore anymore
this music may remind me you this sound is seizing me all alone

it's because i love you too i don't want you to carry me anymore
this music may remind me you this sound is seizing me all alone
it's because i love you too i don't want you to carry me anymore anymore
this music may remind me you this sound is seizing me all alone

it's because i love you too i don't want you to carry me anymore
this music may remind me you this sound is seizing me all alone
