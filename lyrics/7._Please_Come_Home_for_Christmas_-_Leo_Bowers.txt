bells will be ringing the glad glad news
oh what a christmas to have the blues
my baby's gone i have no friends
to wish me greetings once again

choirs will be singing silent night
christmas carols ringing by candle light
please come home for christmas
please come home for christmas
if not for christmas by new years night

friends and relations send salutations
sure as the stars shine above
for this is christmas
yes this is christmas my dear
it's time to be with the one you love

so won't you tell me
you'll never more roam
this christmas and new year will find you home
there'll be no more sorrow
no grief no more pain
and i'll be happy happy christmas once again

there'll be no more sorrow no
yes i'll be happy yeah
i'll be so happy happy christmas once again
