and i promise
i do it i don't care
tired of dozen things
baby let me
be myself please
don't wanna hide again
and i'm always afraid

let me do this whatever
it will make me feel better
please don't look at me that way
let me do this whatever
it will make me feel better
please don't look at me that way

sorry if i'm walking away
but it's better better
baby if you don't love me
why do i have to stay more stay more
