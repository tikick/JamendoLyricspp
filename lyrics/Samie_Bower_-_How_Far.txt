are things going back to how they were
cause i don't want to have to say it no more
i don't want to have to say it no more
there's just some things i can't ignore

cause i don't want to have to say it no more
i don't want to have to say it no more
there's just some things i can't ignore

from times in my car
to when in the back when the rain fall
how far we've been to not talk
we'd be on the phone all midnight long

i been taking the time
to find where i wanna go
had to take a step back
since you said you was doing good
without me by your side
but who am i to say i was right for you
you said i was all you want
is this another fairytale
or a fable
is it really that hard
to say you was able
to do me dirty
do me dirty like that
i gave you all of me
but you lied
and i tried
and you did it all again
there you go talking
lying to your friends
saying it was my fault
when you was on the fence

it's been a year and change
we haven't said anything
maybe you got a ring
maybe i found a thing
but things change
things change yeah
i been cautious more
then often
do i get a say
problems over dollars
and the drama
time passed
but the feelings
got me bothered
a pretty face
with shitty taste
had me caught up
is it worth the wait
to a mistake
was i the problem
in the city of gothem
mob ties and commas
hard times and karma
the batwoman of trauma
my heart turned black
as my thoughts went numb
feeling the tears on my face
telling myself i need space
come one call all
for the greatest escape of all time
toxic love in the form
you say you can't find
i can tell myself that but i know
i'm hoping that you say
