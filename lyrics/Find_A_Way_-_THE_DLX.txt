phone rings it's not you
two nights no sleep
alone in my head
don't know what to do
i know it's true
i don't wanna say it but
you need me way less than i need you

and i know you wanted space so you can think about us
the silence is killing me and i'm freaking out
wanna say all the words that would erase your doubts
but i don't know how
no i don't know how

if i could find a way to tell you that i'm sorry
that i left you brokenhearted
and i wish i never hurt you
if you could find a way to let me try again
know i can be a better man

yea i promise if you could just find a way
then i know we could find a way
yea if you could find a way
then i know we could find a way
find a way back

i try to kill the time and let go
but it's the needing to know
that eats you up inside
thinking bout how we got so low

cause it was all of the little things
conversations of wedding rings had me feeling like we had it all
don't let this moment of doubting
keep us from working it out
we didn't build this
just to watch it fall

if i could find a way to tell you that i'm sorry
that i left you brokenhearted
and i wish i never hurt you
if you could find a way to let me try again
know i can be a better man

yea i promise if you could just find a way
then i know we could find a way
yea if you could find a way
then i know we could find a way
find a way back

i don't have all the money in the world
what i have give it all to you
good times bad times
i want it all and more if i know that i'm with you
and when things get harder you can lean on me
no it won't be easy but if you could find a way

then i know we could find a way
yea if you could find a way
then i know we could find a way
yea if you could find a way
then i know we could find a way
yea if you could find a way
then i know we could find a way
find a way back
