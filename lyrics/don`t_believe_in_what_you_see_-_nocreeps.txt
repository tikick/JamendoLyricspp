the day was dark streets were cold and grey
seemed as rain would wash our dreams away
a thousand faces flowing through my sight
i saw an alley with a little light
some kind of freak sitting on the floor
had some rags on he had nothing more
hey you he wisphered then come over here
feel something pushing down on you with fear

don't believe in what you see
cause your heart feels
some things just seem to be reality

went on closer to him saw his face
his eyes were closed but he was full of grace
he had a candle burning peacefully
seemed to smile seemed to look at me
and now i know that i will never forget
the blind man's voice and what he said
it ain't your eyes that will light your day
there's something different that will lead your way

don't believe in what you see
cause your heart feels
some things just seem to be reality

don't believe in what you see
cause your heart feels
some things just seem to be reality
