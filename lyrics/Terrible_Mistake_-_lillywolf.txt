when it started out it was nothing at all
you were kind of startling
angled and withdrawn
looking for a map of the world or a song
i don't know

suddenly i'm losing my head in a rush
everything is highly defined and i'm fucking up
you can see me running alone in the street
will you though

i can see the bright lights glowing
the alarm starts going
and i think i've made a terrible mistake
but we're all dying anyway
even if it kills me
even if i don't recover
i would rather be killed by a lover
i can see the bright lights

something isn't working i can't find the words
summertime adrenaline left me an afterburn
looking for a map of the world or a song
i don't know

swimming in and out of a chemical sleep
doubled over trying to drown in my bed sheets
you can see me running alone in the street
will you though

i can see the bright lights glowing
the alarm starts going
and i think i've made a terrible mistake
but we're all dying anyway
even if it kills me
even if i don't recover
i would rather be killed by a lover
i can see the bright lights

someday when you see me
i'll be remote controlled
call my name
i'll wave and say hello

i can see the bright lights glowing
the alarm starts going
and i think i've made a terrible mistake
but we're all dying anyway
even if it kills me
even if i don't recover
i would rather be killed by a lover
i can see the bright lights
