gold walls that i built for you
just to dig me out with silver spoons
no i didn't see it coming
oh
gold walls that i'm stuck inside
i guess beauty sees what i can't find
i didn't
no i didn't
see it coming

well i got your gold and i got your message
i want you to know that you are the love of my life
the love of my life
you never leave when the song is over
you rather dance 'til the end

you're the love of my life
you're the love of my life
