hey you don't try lying to me
'cause your eyes are talking to me
you'd better keep your eyes fixing me
and watch me falling for you it's so easy

i see you
don't think about it
i want you
oh yeah baby i love it
i see you
i want you

we're living it it's like a mission
in your eyes with no reason
i wanna read your acceptation
ready to embrace our union

we're living it but don't say about every day and we lie
we're living it but don't say about every day and we lie

in my head i'm burning for you
you should come here and just kiss me
must realize that it's not a game
but understand maybe your chance

i see you
don't think about it
i want you
oh yeah baby i love it
i see you
i want you
don't think about it

we're living it it's like a mission
in your eyes with no reason
i wanna read your acceptation
ready to embrace our union

we're living it but don't say about every day and we lie
we're living it but don't say about every day and we lie
