cigarettes and coffee
sunday morning is the wasteland
i feel as if i got hit by a truck when i wake up but thats ok cause im alive

were having scars as trophies
were always broke due to bad payment
but i never said that i regret and as a fact i wouldnt even if i died no no

i wonder why do i do this im covered with bruises
my lungs are aching and my ears are numb
one might assume its just blatantly stupid
but i wont stop to live my life as a stunt
cause thats what i like to do the music and the groove and lou will find the proof that youre designed to move

and hallelujah god bless this band god bless this band
if hes too busy to save the world we do the best we can we do the best we can
so hallelujah
if hes too busy to save the world we do the best we can again and again and again and again and again

now im advising you to take your dancing shoes and then i would like you to come to the dance and move
and i hope that you then start to understand why this is what we do it gives a lot to you
and you you might stop to think that were just crazy fools and though that may be true
we would be saving you thats what were meant to do

i wonder why do i do this im covered with bruises
my lungs are aching and my ears are numb
one might assume its just blatantly stupid
but i wont stop to live my life as a stunt
cause thats what i like to do the music and the groove and lou will find the proof that youre designed to move

and hallelujah god bless this band god bless this band
if hes too busy to save the world we do the best we can we do the best we can
and hallelujah god bless this band god bless this band
if hes too busy to save the world we do the best we can we do the best we can

i said cigarettes and coffee thats all left in the end
and i hope that it was worth it
yes i hope that it was worth it
and i hope that it was worth it in the end
