this house is full of stale air and the stench of kerosene
these windows ain't been open since the garden here was green
for three months it's been snowing like a monochromic dream
these dusty thoughts of you they won't stop ripping at my seams

maybe you're the medicine that i've been waiting for
but it seems to me the sickness might be better than the cure
i'm always drawn to poison when it's sweet against my tongue
the sugar coating hides it while my body's going numb

so numb
so numb
like sugar on my tongue

my vision is so narrow through this telescopic lens
it magnifies the secrets as the distorted image bends and all i
see is the reflection of someone who looks like you
but i'm too jaded from the journey to make sense of all the truth

but the camera sees the things we miss it freezes us in time
and it catches every frame as we go tumbling through our lives
and it holds us to a standard that we're never gonna meet
the trying is so bitter when the sugar is so

so numb
so numb
like sugar on my tongue

well my mind has been in shambles since you crashed into my life
i've been balancing my weakness on the thin blade of a knife and i keep
slipping into places where i never thought i'd be
if temptation is my guardian i never will be free

so numb
you've won
so numb
like sugar on my tongue
like sugar on my tongue
