and it begins again
feral attraction
its just a matter of when
a chain reaction

a silver bullet can't stop me now
its getting late and the sun's gone down
i hope my feet keep me on the ground
let out a howl and run

into the night
a cold chill runs down your spine
into the night
i feel your body next to mine

into the night
i got a full moon appetite
dance with the devil in pale moonlight
into the night
into the night

and it begins again
and i can't keep it in
it's breaking through my skin
i'll run as fast as i can

a silver bullet can't stop me now
it's getting late and the sun's gone down
i hope my feet keep me on the ground

into the night
a cold chill runs down your spine
into the night
i feel your body next to mine

into the night
i got a full moon appetite
dance with the devil in pale moonlight
into the night
into the night
