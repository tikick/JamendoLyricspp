so fresh so clean
so blessed that means
j and nobody else but me
who can move you the way i do
and i'm upon it right away if i say i do
no this and that no claptrap at all
if someone has a problem i clap back em all
smooth and gentle it's the way i handle
bet ya felt the difference when i came thru
what's your name boo
took your hand whispered in ya ear
you sweet as an angel
i remember you gazing seriously
thanks to a jerk walking up to you previous me
but once i had you loosen up
i introduced myself with a none seducing touch
proved myself to be the trusted type
never thought a club night would show me what real love is like

hold you tight never will i let you go no matter what you might do
always be by your side there's nothing you and i can't get thru
i'm a hold you up baby whenever you have a problem i'm a hold you up
when you dont deserve it aint really worht it
i ma still give you all of my love

somewhere round ninety six
i'm at this party introduced to this dude named mister smith
i'm like wow that song is nice
didn't understand a word but that's quite alright
i moved my lips like i really did knew the lyrics
looked so stupid like some kind of remix
copped that album right away
started to study make my own rhymes night and days
going thru my mind what i would like to say
and finally i was able to bring out everything about me
got my own style and started to represent it proudly
sometimes i go back to old notepads
just to remind myself about the times when i was so whack
but i kept going my vision was clear
like it or not i aint going nowhere

hold you tight never will i let you go no matter what you might do
always be by your side there's nothing you and i can't get thru
i'm a hold you up baby whenever you have a problem i'm a hold you up
when you dont deserve it aint really worht it
i ma still give you all of my love

i'll probably never make million bucks
have enough cash to appeal some love
never drive a car that's fast enough
or be vip for the night up in the clubs
but if you ask me i got pretty enuff
i might not be wealthy but i'm healthy and got some love
so in other words i'm thankful to god
for everything i have and everything i have not

hold you tight never will i let you go no matter what you might do
always be by your side there's nothing you and i can't get thru
i'm a hold you up baby whenever you have a problem i'm a hold you up
when you dont deserve it aint really worht it
i ma still give you all of my love

hold you tight never will i let you go no matter what you might do
always be by your side there's nothing you and i can't get thru
i'm a hold you up baby whenever you have a problem i'm a hold you up
when you dont deserve it aint really worht it
i ma still give you all of my love
