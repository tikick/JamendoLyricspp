i try to forget you babe
but it's only been ten days
i try to keep busy in my own way
befriended by the echoed hallways

cuz when you're gone
just trying to be a part of you
when you're gone
i'm tired of being apart from you

if my eyes can arrest you babe
tell me how you're walking away
a sigh on a window pane
while you're sitting in a cafe

cuz when you're gone
just trying to be a part of you
when you're gone
i'm tired of being apart from you

have patience
a better
and spacious way to be together
putting this forever

all in a day
always i'll wait

i shy from a busy place
lonely like a crowd in la
asides to my pillowcase
is it really about the chase

cuz when you're gone
just trying to be a part of you
when you're gone
i'm tired of being apart from you

have patience
a better
and spacious way to be together
putting this forever

all in a day
always i'll wait

cuz when you're gone
just trying to be a part of you
when you're gone
i'm tired of being apart from you

have patience
a better
and spacious way to be together
putting this forever

all in a day
always i'll wait

have patience
a better
and spacious way to be together
putting this forever

all in a day
always i'll wait

all in a day
always i'll wait
