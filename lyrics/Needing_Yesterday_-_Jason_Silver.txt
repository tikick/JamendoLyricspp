yesterday we were different then
if i could travel back to then
if i could travel
maybe someday we will see again
we'll find the romance we knew then
if we could travel

your eyes are streams and i feel mean
did i have to say
oh for yesterday when we didn't know
know the words to use
the hurtful things to say

yesterday
i want to travel back in time
back to where our love was fine
yesterday
i wish that we could go back to
back to every moment today
not needing yesterday

come with me let's start again
let's find outselves how we were then
when my grandpa died
or that time you cried
i want to go to where we never fought
never paused and never thought
it was better yesterday

yesterday
i want to travel back in time
back to where our love was fine
yesterday
i wish that we could go back to
back to every moment today
not needing yesterday
