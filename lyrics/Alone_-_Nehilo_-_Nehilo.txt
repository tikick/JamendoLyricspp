i'm alone in the dark can i be where you are
you were gone from the start now you tear me apart

i gave you my trust but you treated me like i couldn't see
i thought you were the one
but i know that i'll never be the girl that you need you need

you would feel the same if you were at the back of her mind
suddenly the rain has wiped away the dust from my eyes

i gave you my trust but you treated me like i couldn't see
i thought you were the one
but i know that i'll never be the girl that you need you need
you would feel the same if you were at the back of her mind
suddenly the rain has wiped away the dust from my eyes

i'm alone in the dark can i be where you are
you were gone from the start now you tear me apart

i gave you my trust but you treated me like i couldn't see
i thought you were the one
but i know that i'll never be the girl that you need you need

you would feel the same if you were at the back of her mind
suddenly the rain has wiped away the dust from my eyes

i gave you my trust but you treated me like i couldn't see
i thought you were the one
but i know that i'll never be the girl that you need you need
you would feel the same if you were at the back of her mind
suddenly the rain has wiped away the dust from my eyes
