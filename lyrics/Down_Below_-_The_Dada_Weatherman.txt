'm living outside the rule
they take me for a fool
i'm going down down down down below
i'm going down down down down below

if i give them my middle thought
a finger flip and i'm right out
i'm going down down down down below
i'm going down down down down below

so i'm screaming out loud
everything i think of now
just as long as i've got
my freedom of thoughts intact

and i see the devil in the detail
and i'm feeling they're all on my tail

i'm walking right now the green mile
they got me stranded here in time
i'm going down down down down below
yes i'm going down down down down down below

and if i dare to turn around
they gonna rip my insides round and round
some smoke of cigarette
and sounds of a russian roulette

and i see the devil in the detail
and i'm feeling they're all on my tail
