i'm like the dog that no one would feed
scrawny stinky and strong
and like the dog i never did good
always doing stuff wrong

but when they caught me with the mayors wife
i had to run like a greyhound dog
i hid myself way back in bayou land
but they found me trapped in the bog

im a bad man
from the wrong side of town
i think they gunna put me down
ill put up a fight
when they string me up tight
i think they gunna kill me tonight

trussed like a turkey set for thanksgiving day
they chained me up and locked me away
at least i got the meals id been prayin for
shoved to me under the door

the preacher read my rites from his battered book
but i didn't pay no heed
the mayors wife had come just a short while before
and left me with the jail house key
and she left me with the jail house key

im a bad man
from the wrong side of town
they think they gunna put me down
but ill take flight
before they string me up tight
they think they gunna kill me tonight

im a bad man
from the wrong side of town
they think they gunna put me down
but ill take flight
before they string me up tight
they think they gunna kill me tonight

im a bad man
from the wrong side of town
they think they gunna put me down
but ill take flight
before they string me up tight
they think they gunna kill me tonight
