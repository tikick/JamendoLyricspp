there's not a single day that passes
without you on my mind
not even one minute can end up
before you come around
i aim for the days when i see your face here before me
i long for the times you held me in your arms

how i wish that you were here
to give me everything i want

but i know that live's unfair
and we can't always have it all

i wish that you were here
i wish that you were here
