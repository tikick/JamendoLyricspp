it was just two of us alone in the night
we had just met and yet i felt so secure

i told you
please stay for a while
under the sky of shooting stars
please stay for a while
beyond the city's crowded streets

i knew i just knew
when i set my eyes on you
you're all i wanted
you're the one i sing for

i knew i just knew
when i set my eyes on you
you're all i wanted
you're the one i waited
you're the one i waited for

it's still two of us after all these years
our love is not gone and i'm glad i told you

i told you
please stay for a while
under the sky of shooting stars
please stay for a while
beyond the city's crowded streets

i knew i just knew
when i set my eyes on you
you're all i wanted
you're the one i sing for

i knew i just knew
when i set my eyes on you
you're all i wanted
you're the one i waited
you're the one i waited for

you're the one i waited for
you're the one i waited for
you're the one i waited for

i knew i just knew
when i set my eyes on you
you're all i wanted
you're the one i sing for

i knew i just knew
when i set my eyes on you
you're all i wanted
you're the one i waited for

you're the one i waited for
you're the one i waited for
