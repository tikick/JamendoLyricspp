better run better run better run
better run better run

devastating earthquake
i can make the floor shake
split level pipe burst
wall to wall waterworks
crunch of steel burst of flame
plaster shower crystal rain
hardware glassware
everything you see

get down now
the world twists things around you
come on now
it's all about to change

i am a demon i'm a dream cut down
a nightmare from the underground
now the things i touch are easily crushed
better run better run i'm dangerous

better run better run better run
better run better run

rosebud blood blooms
all over the bathroom
copper guts water mains
open up their cold veins
wear a chandelier crown
all your treasure's trash now
busted mirrors
everything you see

get down now
the world twists things around you
come on now
it's all about to change

i am a demon i'm a dream cut down
a nightmare from the underground
now the things i touch are easily crushed
better run better run i'm dangerous

when it stops
i can see
silent graveyards of debris
wooden bones
broken homes
fractured city scenery

better run better run better run
better run better run better run
