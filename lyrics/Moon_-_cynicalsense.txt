the moon the sea the waves crashing beneath a black sky full of lights
this gloomy landscape is the dark picture of your nights
a cold wind freezing your thoughts
lets you motionless

i came by once upon a time
with a midnight clock like those that chime
to wake you up from this battle you fought
and to bring you back to life

but you didn't want to follow me you ran away from me
though i tried for days and days to dry the sea
you stayed locked up in your mind
though i tried to turn off the moon

tonight i write this song for you
to maybe reach your deeply buried heart
i want to stay with you for eternity
listening to the silence of our souls
