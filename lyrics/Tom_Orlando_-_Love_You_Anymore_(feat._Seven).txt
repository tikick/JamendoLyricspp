i don't really love you anymore
don't wanna know where you are
you don't answer the phone
don't wanna know where you been
since you've never came home
gave you chance after chance
after chance after chance and i'm tired
i don't wanna dance
wanna dance wanna dance
around this ring of fire

i don't really love you anymore
don't know what the fuck i'm wylin for
i don't even need you by my side
i don't even wanna call you mine
i never wanna see you
again and again and again
and again
this is really the end
i don't really love you anymore
don't know what the fuck i'm wylin for
don't know what the fuck i'm
don't wanna don't wanna

yo
why's it so hard for me
to see you moving on
all the pain thats deep up in to my chest
how you up and left
and i said
i would never let you down
but you let me down
fucked around and i found out
looked through your phone and i saw the texts now
how can you do this to me when i gave you my heart and a family
you were the one that i loved but i see it was all an anomaly
looking ahead to the road that is set
gotta face all my demons and fight em instead
i aint putting up with all the shit that you put me through
all the abuse and the lies i'm done with you
but the truth is
i don't know what i can do
all of the fear that i'm feeling
when lookin for somebody new
killing the mood
i don't trust nobody boo
i give that all to you
but now you calling my phone and i hope that you know that

i don't really love you anymore
don't know what the fuck i'm wylin for
i don't even need you by my side
i don't even wanna call you mine
i never wanna see you
again and again and again
and again
this is really the end
i don't really love you anymore
don't know what the fuck i'm wylin for
don't know what the fuck i'm
