she's southern california
with a hint of tennessee
and i'm just a boy from florida
what could she see in me

every night
she's the one that i dream of
and when the sun comes up
she illuminates my love
my love my love

your golden
like the coast of california
where the oceans are so blue
you got my heart you got my soul

cuz baby your golden
like the coast of california
where the oceans are so blue
you got my heart you got my soul

she's cruisin' down the highway
and her body's bathed in gold
and the sunlight tries to keep up
but the girls too quick to hold

every night
she illuminates my love
my love my love

your golden
like the coast of california
where the oceans are so blue
you got my heart you got my soul

cuz baby your golden
like the coast of california
where the oceans are so blue
you got my heart you got my soul

the sun and the moon
and all of the stars that surround her
and you gotta you gotta see
the colors that dance all around her

cuz baby your golden
like the coast of california
where the oceans are so blue
you got my heart you got my soul

cuz baby your golden
like the coast of california
where the oceans are so blue
you got my heart you got my soul
