it's ev'rythin' so cloudy misty here
that no profile or color can be found
i've been so eagerly seekin' all throughout these years
not to remain a blinded out

no shinin' no windows no escape from this appearance
the motive the reason the lovely scene that joined us
i'm feelin' a stranger my hands are melting like hot wax
can't touch ya can't feel ya this dream has broken us apart

i just reached a point of no return far beyond the light

an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that joined us
an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that bleeds my eyes
an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that crushes my mind
an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that leeds me to die

i thought i was so happy with you
lookin' at my temptin' caleidoscope
but realized it was not true
yes i'm dyin'

an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that joined us
an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that bleeds my eyes
an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that crushes my mind
an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that leeds me to die

an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that joined us
an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that bleeds my eyes
an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that crushes my mind
an unreal dream an unreal dream an unreal dream that leeds me to die
