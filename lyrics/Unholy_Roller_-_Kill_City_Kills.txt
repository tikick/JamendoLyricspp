the war machine of mass confusion
it chews you up and spits you out
it spits you out

we are the part of chain reaction baby
you know once started it will never stop

look out

hallelujah
it's approaching to ya
alright

like an animal
unholy roller
just take it all
that's your chance it's now or never

killer on the run
unholy roller
just take it all
with no breaks rush out of control

the point break of your denial
fucked up confessions of your mind
whats on your mind

the primal fear you call the terror baby
you can always like it when it treats you right

hallelujah
load up a silver bullet
shot right to your head

like an animal
unholy roller
just take it all
that's your chance it's now or never

killer on the run
unholy roller
just take it all
with no breaks rush out of control

hallelujah
load up that silver bullet
shot right to your head

like an animal
unholy roller
just take it all
that's your chance it's now or never

killer on the run
unholy roller
just take it all
with no breaks rush out of control yeah

unholy roller
now or never
unholy roller
just take it all
with no breaks rush out of control
suck it
