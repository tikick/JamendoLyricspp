there's a place in my neighborhood
where i like to go
people watching every shape and size
see the masses pose
down and out in the gutter
designer label clothes
tattooed philosophers
i seen them come and seen them go
see it all everyday
killing time on broadway

hey man hey man hey man
can you spare a little change
been down on my luck
i've been to hell and back again
i'm looking for a buck or two
get me on my way
i'm looking for a kind soul
to help me out today
life's so hard they all say
killing time on broadway

all the beautiful people
come on out to play
they frolic in the sunshine
they got nothing to say

walking past the restaurants
checking out the view
you can smell the loneliness in the air
you can taste it in the dew
waiting for the rain
wash away the pain
wash away the emptiness
and bring it back again
we lost some souls along the way
killing time on broadway
