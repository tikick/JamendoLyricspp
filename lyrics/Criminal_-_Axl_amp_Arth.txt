everywhere i go
in these busy streets
imma criminal
every day and night
moving slow mo in the
fast life

i'm on the edge of a skyscraper
counting the stars like city lights
i don't know where i'll end up later
maybe lost in the ashes
lost in the ashes

i'm running i'm running
i'm running i'm running
i'm running i'm running
i'm running from myself

everywhere i go
in these busy streets
imma criminal
every day and night
moving slow mo in the
fast life

oooh imma criminal
oooh yeah imma criminal

blood on my hands fighting my demons
it's a war zone inside this jungle
trouble follows everywhere i'm moving
call me a savage
call me a savage

i'm running i'm running
i'm running i'm running
i'm running i'm running
i'm running from myself

everywhere i go
in these busy streets
imma criminal
every day and night
moving slow mo in the
fast life

everywhere i go
in these busy streets
imma criminal
every day and night
moving slow mo in the
fast life

oooh imma criminal
oooh yeah imma criminal

i'm running i'm running
i'm running i'm running
i'm running i'm running
i'm running from myself

everywhere i go
in these busy streets
imma criminal
every day and night
moving slow mo in the
fast life

everywhere i go
in these busy streets
imma criminal
every day and night
moving slow mo in the
fast life

oooh imma criminal
oooh yeah imma criminal
