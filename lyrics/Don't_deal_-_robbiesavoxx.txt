you want to do something that's hot
could be in your style but you need to be stronger
cause too many times you say i can't
you would like to bite but shyness hold you back
hold you back

i don't know what's right and what's the matter
come on just live your life my friend
time blow strong you're like a leaf in the wind
then don't deal
cause compromises are fears
and you can't have no satisfaction

stuck in a rut you can't make you choises
prisoner of drawbacks society blind and rotten
never ever shared something with them
you would like to scream and shout loud fuck you damned
fuck you damned

i don't know what's right and what's the matter
come on just live your life my friend
time blow strong you're like a leaf in the wind
then don't deal
cause compromises are fears
and you can't have no satisfaction

i don't know what's right and what's the matter
come on just live your life my friend
time blow strong you're like a leaf in the wind
then don't deal
cause compromises are fears
and you can't have no satisfaction
