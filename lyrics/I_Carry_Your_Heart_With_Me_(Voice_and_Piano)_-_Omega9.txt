i carry your heart with me
i carry it in my heart i'm never without it
anywhere i go you go my dear
and whatever is done by only me is your doing

i fear no fate
for you are my fate my sweet
you are my fate
i want no world
for beautiful you are my world my true
my true

and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant
whatever a sun will always sing is you
here is the deepest secret nobody knows
here's the root of the root and the bud of the bud
and the sky of the sky tree called life which grows
higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide
this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart

i carry your heart
i carry it in my heart

i fear no fate
for you are my fate my sweet
you are my fate
i want no world
for beautiful you are my world my true
my true my true
