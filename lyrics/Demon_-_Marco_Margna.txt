totally i've lost my way
don't know if it is night or day
chaos it seems
floating on the waves of life
can't find a place to dock my yacht
sos

day by day i have to run away
from your love girl you're always on my way
i know i'm gonna be betrayed
but still i fell in love

why are you following me you're like a demon
why are you trying to catch me give me a reason
will i ever get back my heart and freedom
again you tearing me deeper
when the night comes

in my dreams you're haunting me
from angels eyes then look at me
who really you are
life seems like a quiz to me
don't know what answer right should be
