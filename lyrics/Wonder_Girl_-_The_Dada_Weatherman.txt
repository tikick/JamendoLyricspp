you were my lover and you were my life
sometimes my mother sometimes my child
you got me up you layed me down turned me around
right and left or right or wrong
right until you left me alone with a song
i'll never sing

you were my sister and you were my dear friend
sometimes my daughter a soul mate in the end
but i've always felt like a stranger or a newcomer in your eye
like i never knew your next move or word
you unpredictable girl

you were my love you were my life
my wonder girl saving me everytime
there is one thing one thing i'm sure that you were
love of my life
