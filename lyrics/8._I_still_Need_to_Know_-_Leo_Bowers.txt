i can't understand how you could just walk away
i tried understanding but i couldn't think straight
so i told myself you had your reasons for leaving
and still to this day i wonder what i did wrong
and i still need to know why you had to go

looking back now it seems like it was a dream
we've gotten older and wiser now or so it would seem
now i'm not trying to say you owe me anything
but it sure would be nice if we could understand our past
and i still need to know why you had to go

you used to be a special part of me
until that dreadful day just took it all away
i've made mistakes i know that i cannot hide
there's no running away it's with me to stay

i'll never understand how you gave up everything
i thought you'd come back and we'd be together to stay
i still tell myself you had your reasons for leaving
and still to this day i wonder what i did wrong
and i still need to know why you had to go

i still need to know why you had to go
i still need to know why you had to go
i still need to know why you had to go
