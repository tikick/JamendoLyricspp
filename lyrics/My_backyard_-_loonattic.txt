i don't care about your words anymore
i'll rest my head on my bed
where everything is perfect
on my backyard

memories they have gone to my basement
where nothing is just perfect
like all the things you told me
but my backyard

i'll find in there my heart and my hope
i'll never fall 'cause i'll find my god
no evil comes i'll be on my own
i'll never find another bad word
i'll never talk about our love
a shining sun on my backyard

you've never seen its secret place
a path of roses smells on your face
you've never slept on my feather bed
just made of dreams you won't have any fear
you've never flown my universe
where every star spark on your eyes
you've never thought i wait here
you never think i love you

i'll find in there my heart and my hope
i'll never fall 'cause i'll find my god
no evil comes i'll be on my own
i'll never find another bad word
i'll never talk about our love
a shining sun on my backyard

i'll find in there my heart and my hope
i'll never fall 'cause i'll find my god
no evil comes i'll be on my own
i'll never find another bad word
