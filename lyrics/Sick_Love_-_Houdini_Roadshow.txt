you really got style with your highheeled way
it's driving me wild that you wouldn't have me
when we're out into this world when we're taking the show
you never show that you're mine but i love it and i go

i go for sick love
you just blow me all away girl
you just blow me all away girl
oh sick love sick love

you really turn heads when you're walk in the door
you got everyone high but you got me on the floor
i love the sweet pain when you're taking your time
and i know when we're alone you're gonna be all mine all mine

i go for sick love

you just blow me all away girl
you just blow me all away girl
oh sick love sick love

you just blow me all away girl
you just blow me all away girl
oh sick love sick love

i go for sick love

you just blow me all away girl
you just blow me all away girl
oh sick love sick love

you just blow me all away girl
you just blow me all away girl
oh sick love sick love

sick love sick love sick love sick love sick love sick love sick love sick love
