now that we're old grey and almost there
do you still think it's necessary to beware
of the mean tough and big world outside our room
in my opinion there really is nothing we could do

about the big world that lies beyond
you know these people and they're not fond
of people with grey hair like you and me
strange to see this is our family

grey is my feeling
grey is my hair
i'm gonna tell god when i get there
grey is my feeling
about the world outside
i sure hope he takes me in tonight

grey is my feeling
grey is my hair
i'm gonna tell god when i get there
grey is my feeling
about the world outside
i sure hope he takes me in tonight

playing some cards while a man is collected
how come people with grey hair got so rejected
they give us shelter from the world outside
still there's nowhere to run or hide

we stopped hoping a long time ago
for a fresh wind willing to blow
our grey feelings outside this place
instead we're praying for lesser days

grey is our feeling
grey is our hair
we're gonna tell god when we get there
grey is our feeling
about the world outside
we sure hope he takes us in tonight

grey is our feeling
grey is our hair
we're gonna tell god when we get there
grey is our feeling
about the world outside
we sure hope he takes us in tonight
