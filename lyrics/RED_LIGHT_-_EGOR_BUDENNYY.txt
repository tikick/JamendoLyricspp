i've been waiting for so long
try to get things going on
my mental health is about to break
it's give and take game it's give and take
out of control in strange state
there's no reason left to wait
you make me lose my head and mind
i get unwind

you gotta give me this
no red light
want to have all of this
all night
when we're so close to this
no red light
ain't no red light
don't tell me no i need
no red light
refuse to do this
it's a suicide
i can't get over this
no red light
ain't no red light

i've been patient i've been good
so don't let me be misunderstood
your body needs mine almost all of the time
say you'll be here say you'll be mine
in a chaos in a mess
i lived lately i need to confess
you make me lose my head and mind
i get unwind

you gotta give me this
no red light
want to have all of this
all night
when we're so close to this
no red light
ain't no red light
don't tell me no i need
no red light
refuse to do this
it's a suicide
i can't get over this
no red light
ain't no red light

you gotta give me this
no red light
want to have all of this
all night
when we're so close to this
no red light
ain't no red light
don't tell me no i need
no red light
refuse to do this
it's a suicide
i can't get over this
no red light
ain't no red light
