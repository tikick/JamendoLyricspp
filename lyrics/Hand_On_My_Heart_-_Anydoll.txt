it's early morning
time is standing still
there is no rush
just a loving touch

we are here now
the world is everywhere
spread your wings
i will lead you there

i would cry with you throughout the sleepless night
and when the sun comes up everything would be all right

with a hand on my heart
i'll promise you
i'll guide you through no matter what

with a hand on my heart
i'll promise you
i'm always there
and will love you

i hold you close
when you are still asleep
and watch the sweetest thing i've ever seen

you wanna reach out
you wanna see it all
i lift you up
and i won't let you fall

i would laugh with you throughout the sleepless night
and when the sun comes up everything is still all right

with a hand on my heart
i'll promise you
i'll guide you through no matter what

with a hand on my heart
i'll promise you
i'm always there
and will love you

with a hand on my heart
i'll promise you
i'll guide you through no matter what

with a hand on my heart
i'll promise you
i'm always there
and will love you

with a hand on my heart
i'll promise you
i'll guide you through no matter what

with a hand on my heart
i'll promise you
i'm always there
and will love you
