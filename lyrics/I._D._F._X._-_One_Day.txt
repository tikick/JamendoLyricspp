i have a dream of leaving the town i'm living in
not going up not going down but away one day
nobody can stop me from doing this way

i'm gonna try i'm gonna find a pretty girl
and the very next day we're gonna fly far away and stay
stay

a little bit of happiness for a day
a little bit of love without pain
a little bit of sunshine and a perfect sunset
i'll go i'll get

i'm gonna try i'm gonna find a pretty girl
and the very next day we're gonna fly far away and stay
nobody can stop me from doing this way

and somewhere out there i'll find
and somewhere out there

a little bit of happiness for a day
a little bit of love without pain
a little bit of sunshine and a perfect sunset
i'll go i'll get

i have a dream of leaving the town i'm living in
not going up not going down far away and stay
stay

a little bit of happiness for a day
a little bit of love without pain
a little bit of sunshine and a perfect sunset
i'll go i'll get

a little bit of happiness for a day
a little bit of love without pain
a little bit of sunshine and a perfect sunset
i'll go i'll get
i'll go i'll get
